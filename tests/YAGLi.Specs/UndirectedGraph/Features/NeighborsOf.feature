Feature: NeighborsOf

Scenario: Get the neighbors of a vertex not contained in a undirected graph
	Given the property allow loops
	And the property allow parallel edges
	And the vertices
	| Name |
	| v0   |
	| v1   |
	| v2   |
	| v3   |
	| v4   |
	And the edges
    | End1 | End2 |
	| v0   | v1   |
	| v1   | v4   |
	| v4   | v4   |
	| v4   | v3   |
	| v3   | v4   |
	And the undirected graph created with them
	When I retrieve the neighbors of "v5"
	Then I get an empty list of vertices
